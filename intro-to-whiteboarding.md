# White Boarding

The Whats the Whys the Hows

### What is White Boarding?

One of the unique parts about becoming a developer is that interviewing for the job looks very different that most other industries. This is because traditional education isn't as big of a deal in this industry as in others. So employers need a different way to evaluate your technical skills.

There are lots of ways this can happen during an interview: asking technical questions, having you pair with a developer from the team, giving you a take home test, or they can ask you to white board. White boarding is literally handing you a dry erase marker asking you to code. In a virtual setting it is giving you a blank screen and asking you to code. This can be pretty intimidating when you are already nervous about an interview. So we want to give you lots of practice here in a safe and friendly environment.

### Why are we practicing white boarding?
White boarding is not necessarily the best way to assess a candidates technical strengths. No one codes without Google or without notes. Developers don't memorize things. But it is a bit of a tradition or rite of passage for developers.

But apart from it being a tradition, there is actual value in white boarding. The main thing is that a tech lead wants to know what you do when you don't know how to solve a problem. Really your interviewer is not necessarily interested in your curly braces or your commas, they want to see you solve a problem. And they want to see how you ask questions, how you think and reason under pressure. That is going to tell them more about you than anything you write down on a whiteboard or a blank screen.

### How does this go?
We are going to do a virtual white boarding exercise. We will ask you a coding challenge you will type in a blank text editor.

White boarding is NOT about the code itself.

White boarding is about communication.
Shifting your focus from trying to write perfect code with perfect logic to trying to sell yourself as a human that people want to work with.

This is also your opportunity to see if the company is going to be a good fit for you. Remember that during an interview, you are interviewing them as much as much they are interviewing you. One of the biggest fears is what if they are mean or judge you for being nervous. If that is the case, do you want to be on a team where that is how they treat their junior developers? Maybe that is your jam - maybe you thrive under that kind of pressure. Great. But if you don't, then at that point you are interviewing them for the roll of your mentor and THEY are not having a very good interview.

### How can you be successful at white boarding?
- Interact with the interviewer
- Ask questions!!!
- Pseudo code
- Walk through the problem in English and check in with the interviewer
- Check your input and output
- Write pseudo tests using words like "expect" and "describe"
- Ask if there is a time limit
- Go the long way and refactor if you have time
- It is okay to say you don't know, but follow it with a plan
- If you say you need to look something up, describe exactly what you would Google
